This script takes three video inputs and creates a single triptych output video.

Gamma correction is applied with a tuneable global variable.

Note: If filming with a smartphone, enable Auto Exposure Lock while filming the three video inputs. This will prevent the lighting from auto-adjusting, which is not straightforward to fix with gamma (or other) corrections.
